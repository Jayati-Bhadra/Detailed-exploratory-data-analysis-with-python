# Detailed-exploratory-data-analysis-with-python
This is the very first data analysis I do on my own. Please take the informations on this notebook with a grain of salt. I'm open to all improvements (even rewording), don't hesitate to leave me a comment or upvote if you found it useful. If I'm completely wrong somewhere or if my findings makes no sense don't hesitate to leave me a comment.

This work was influenced by some kernels of the same competition as well as the Stanford: Statistical reasoning MOOC

The purpose of this EDA is to find insights which will serve us later in another notebook for Data cleaning/preparation/transformation which will ultimately be used into a machine learning algorithm. We will proceed as follow:
Where each steps (Data exploration, Data cleaning, Model building, Presenting results) will belongs to 1 notebook. I will write down a lot of details in this notebook (even some which may seems obvious by nature), as a beginner it's important for me to do so.
